Use this package by setting something like
```bash
export PYTHONSTARTUP="{...}/pythonrc/src.py"
```
in your `.bashrc` login file.

This package simply imports various commonly used (by me) packages and sets up a few helpful functions and variables, upon starting up python (e.g. starting a python shell through `python`).
